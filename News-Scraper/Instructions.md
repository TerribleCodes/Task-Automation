#Setting up the mail

- Gmail might not work: https://support.google.com/accounts?p=less-secure-apps&hl=en_GB
- Best way is to create a GMX mail account: https://www.gmx.com/mail/create-email-address/
- To set up the SMTP move to "Settings" > "POP & IMAP" > Check "Enable access to this account via POP3 and IMAP"
- Use GMX account details as the Sender mail and the Password
