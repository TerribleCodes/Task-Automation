### Setting up the mail

- This is a small program created to forward HackerNews headlines to a mail without GUI.
- Gmail might not work when sending. But works when receiving. https://support.google.com/accounts?p=less-secure-apps&hl=en_GB
> Best way is to create a GMX mail account: https://www.gmx.com/mail/create-email-address/
>> To set up the SMTP move to "Settings" > "POP & IMAP" > Check "Enable access to this account via POP3 and IMAP". Use GMX account details as the Sender mail and the Password.
